# State-of-the-art
What I would chose to implement a new system...

## Paradigm

### Compiled
- "Efficiently compiling efficient query plans for modern hardware" by Neumann

### Interpreted
- "MonetDB/X100: Hyper-Pipelining Query Execution" by Boncz et al.

## Parallelism
- "Morsel-driven parallelism: a NUMA-aware query evaluation framework for the many-core age" by Leis et al.

## Advanced Operators
- Window functions: "Efficient processing of window functions in analytical SQL queries" by Leis et al.

## Concurrency Control
- "Fast Serializable Multi-Version Concurrency Control for Main-Memory Database Systems" by Neumann et al.

## Optimizer
- "Dynamic programming strikes back" by Moerkotte et al.

## Buffer Manager
- Assuming most fits into memory and everything is part of a tree structure "LeanStore: In-Memory Data Management Beyond Main Memory" by Leis et al.
